## Overview  
Python has many elegant features that can show the difference between a “programmer who uses Python” and a true “Pythonista”

Pythonista may be a silly word but it’s a real thing. A true pythonista is able to leverage the particular features of Python to accomplish a task in a simpler and more easy to reason about way.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  
- [x] Create examples demonstrating pythonic language features. For example…
  - Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to…
    - add ability to be used in a for in loop
    - add ability to be used in a list comprehension
    - add ability to convert to a list or other collection type
  - [x] Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example…
    - Calculate the time spent in the function
    - Log relevant info for debugging purposes
    - Slow down the function
    - Convert the return value in some way
    - Validate some condition on the way in
  - [x] Use dunder methods make your code more readable and elegant. For example…
    - add ability for two custom data structure to be considered equal
    - add ability for custom data structure to be considered truthy/falsy  
  - Anything else that catches your interest

## Implementation Notes:  
- Describe your findings in README
- Optionally create your project as a Jupyter Notebook if you prefer
  - In that case add tests as asserts within Notebook

## User Acceptance Tests  
- Create unit tests to demonstrate the features you select.  

## Findings

There is still much to learn on the topic of magic methods. It was interesting to learn about generators and iterators and what they can do but its not an easy topic to remember. I really like decorators. I have not found a good use case for them, or have any idea to apply them but its rather interesting. I know we touched on them like week two for a project or seen them not used them. It just shows that python has so much to offer that we don't know yet.
